# HeckerShell Project

HeckerShell has been in development for a couple years now.
It originally began as some personal settings built on top of
oh-my-zsh's existing framework, but it has since grown out of that.
I have completely replaced oh-my-zsh's files and settings with my own,
thus eliminating much unneeded bloat. All plugins, shell themes, scripts,
and configs are custom developed to suit my workflow, and all loading
logic for these configs are handled by a top-level config for each shell.

Both ZSH and Bash can use most of these settings; however, each shell has
a reloadable config for those settings that cannot be used for both.
